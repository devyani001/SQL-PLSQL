35 . WEATHER OBSERVATION STATION 18
====================================

Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

========

/*
Enter your query here.
*/
-- select MIN(LAT_N) AS a , MIN(LONG_W) AS b, MAX(LAT_N) AS c, MAX(LONG_W) AS d from station;

select FORMAT( ABS(MIN(LAT_N) - MAX(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)) , 4 ) from station;



Q. what i learnt today ?
-------------------------
1. print upto 2 decimal
   MySQL - FORMAT(amount , 2)
   SQL   - ROUNT(amount , 2)

When to use which?
-------------------
Function	Use case
ROUND(x,2)	When you only need numeric rounding
FORMAT(x,2)	When you want formatted output (pretty print)

1️⃣ ROUND(x, 2) – Numeric rounding

What it does:

ROUND() simply rounds the number to the specified number of decimal places.

The result is still a numeric value, which you can use in calculations.

Example:

SELECT ROUND(1234.5678, 2) AS rounded_value;


Output:

rounded_value
1234.57

✅ Notice:

Rounded to 2 decimal places.

Output is numeric → you can do further math on it (+, *, etc.).

No commas added for thousands.

2️⃣ FORMAT(x, 2) – Pretty formatting

What it does:

FORMAT() rounds like ROUND(), but returns a string, and formats the number with commas for thousands.

Example:

SELECT FORMAT(1234.5678, 2) AS formatted_value;


Output:

formatted_value
1,234.57

✅ Notice:

Rounded to 2 decimal places.

Commas inserted automatically for thousands.

Output is text, not numeric → you can’t directly perform arithmetic on it.

🔑 Key Difference
Feature	ROUND(x,2)	FORMAT(x,2)
Rounds number	✅	✅
Adds commas	❌	✅
Returns numeric	✅	❌ (returns string)
Can use in calculations	✅	❌
Good for display / reports	❌	✅
💡 Practical Tip

Use ROUND() when you want to store, calculate, or compare numbers.

Use FORMAT() when you want to show results to the user nicely in reports or dashboards.

2. ABS - absolute values
3. subtraction is possible of two columns
