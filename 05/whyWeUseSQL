Q. Why SQL is Used ?
----------------------
    1. SQL is used to perform CRUD Operations.
    2. SQL is used to merge 'logically related data'.
    3. SQL is used to 'Normalized Data'.



1. SQL is used to perform CRUD Operations.
--------------------------------------------
    C - CREATE          Creating database or tables

    R - READ            Fetching   data from a table
                        Displaying data from a table

    U - UPDATE          Either we are modifying one record or multiple records

    D - DELETE          Either we are deleting  one record or multiple records



2. SQL is used to merge 'logically related data'.
---------------------------------------------------

--> Merging logically related data means you are combining more than one tables.
--> Tables are combined only when they should have atleast one common attribute(Field/column).
--> Combining tables is nothing but JOIN Operations.

            Student                                                 Teacher
    rno | name | per | city                                 tno | tname | salary | city

- SELECT * FROM Student, Teacher;
    he donhi nhi kru skt he krayala at least 1 row common pahije.

Example :
Can you Find student & teacher from same city.
Can you give name of student & teacher, those are from Old-Sangvi.



3. SQL is used to 'Normalized Data'.
--------------------------------------

--> SQL is used to 'normalize data' means SQL helps implement the normalization process by creating well-structured, 
    relational tables that reduce 'redundancy' and maintain 'data integrity'.


--> Pratyek 'Cell' madhe 'ekach' value asnar hi assurity tumhala DBMS dete ya process la 'Normalization' mhnte.

            Student
    rno | name | per | phno
    101 | AAA  | 60  | 9999, 7777               Not possible 9999, 7777
    102 | BBB  | 70  | 8888

--> u cannot store 2 values in one Cell.
--> for that u need to add one extra column 'Contact'.

            Student
    rno | name | per | phno | Contact
    101 | AAA  | 60  | 9999 | 7777
    102 | BBB  | 70  | 8888 | NULL              student kde phone ch nhi


                 Student

                       |       Contact       |
    | rno | name | per | contact1 | Contact2 |
    | 101 | AAA  | 60  | 9999     | 7777     |
    | 102 | BBB  | 70  | 8888     | NULL     |         student kde phone ch nhi


--> Ithe rno, name, per, contact bss he 4 ch column bnte
    contact1, contact2 asa code nhi krta yet.

--> designer E-R diagram deto

        rno     name    per    contact              // Attributes   --> Columns

                   Student                          // Entity       --> Tables
                 ER Diagram

--> Entity    becomes 'Table'.
--> Attribute becomes 'Columns'.
--> Developer banvatana columns kiti bnvate lagnar ahe 5.
--> Actual columns kiti ahe 4.
