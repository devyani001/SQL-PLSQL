Relationships in SQL
=====================
--> In SQL and relational databases, a relationship refers to a logical connection between two or more tables using keys — typically primary keys and foreign keys.

--> These relationships help maintain data consistency, integrity, and allow structured querying across multiple tables.

There are 3 types of Relationships in SQL-
	1. Many-to-Many (M-M)
	2. 1-M / M-1
	3. 1-1
