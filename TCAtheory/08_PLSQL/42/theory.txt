Cursor in PLSQL
===============
--> A cursor is a database object (or temporary work area in memory) created when an SQL SELECT statement is executed inside a procedure/function.
--> It stores the result set (rows returned by the query). 
--> The result set stored by the cursor is called the 'active set'. 
--> A cursor can hold multiple rows in its active set, but it allows you to process only one row at a time (by FETCH). 

--> There are two types of CURSOR -
	1. implicit cursor
	2. Explicit Cusror
