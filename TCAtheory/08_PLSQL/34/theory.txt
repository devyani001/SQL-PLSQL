PLSQL
=======
--> PL/SQL is procedural language extension for SQL. 

--> PL/SQL is a procedural programming language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.

--> PL/SQL provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages. 

--> PL/SQL can execute several queries in one block (function block) using single command. 

--> One can create a PL/SQL unit(block code) such as procedures, functions, cursors, triggers which are stored in the database for reuse by applications. 

--> PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block. 

Example:
--------
--> PostgreSQL has its own procedural language called PL/pgSQL, which is conceptually like PL/SQL.

--> MySQL supports stored programs (procedures, functions, triggers) with SQL/PSM (Persistent Stored Module) syntax, also similar but with some differences. 

stored Procedure:
----------------
Ase routine jyala value return karata yet nahi = Procedure

stored function
---------
Ase routine jyala value return karata yete  = function


select msg();
drop function msg();


select msg();
drop function msg;

Main Module
------------
1. Function
2. Procedure
3. cursor
4. Trigger
5. view


String msg()
{
	
	return "Hello World";
}
